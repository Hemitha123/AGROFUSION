Our project AgroFusion - Intelligent Farmer Assistance Platform is mainly to design an AI-based decision support system that helps farmers make informed, timely and profitable farming decisions by integrating crop planning, risk prediction, disease detection etc., into a single platform

How It Works- 
Farmer inputs farm details → backend combines weather data, soil compatibility and AI models → system generates crop plan, risk score, and profit estimate.

● What-If Farming Simulation-
Maximizes farm productivity by recommending crop combinations that increase yield and income per acre. 
● Market Sell Timing Advisor- 
Provides data-driven recommendations on when to sell produce, reducing losses from price changes. 
● Prediction Alerts-
Uses local weather insights to protect crops and optimize use of water, fertilizer and pesticides. 
● AI Disease Detection- 
Reduces crop losses through instant, photo-based disease detection and treatment guidance.
